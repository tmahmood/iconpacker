Hi!

This is the version 2 of Gnome Icon Packaging Utility. It have some mejor improvements.
Its far far better version then previous version.
 

1. No more of the ugly shell script :) everything have been moved to the Python base

2. Now the tool will always follow the GNOME Icon themes standard.

3. Adding new category [TODO:]

4. Theme files are not saved as XML anymore. So you can guess version 1's themes are useless now.

5. A file browser have been integrated (with image preview), so searching for icons is more easier

6. Still working on a way to display progress when building the theme

7. Image Resizing is done properly :p

6. Only PNG files are supported now

8. We are using /tmp folder to build theme

9. Will also generate a tar.gz file for distribution of the theme


No spam please


Thats it for now, 
thanks
